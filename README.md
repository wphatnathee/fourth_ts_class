# Express TS 4th Workshop

## 📝 About the Project

This repository is for the **Express TS 4th Workshop**. It aims to establish a proper backend development environment using Express and TypeScript. The setup includes essential tools for code quality, formatting, and API documentation, providing a strong foundation for building reliable and scalable applications.

## ✨ Features

- **Swagger** - API documentation tool for clear and interactive documentation
- **ESLint** - Linter for identifying and fixing code errors and standardizing code style
- **Prettier** - Code formatter for consistent styling
- **Husky** - Git hooks for pre-commit checks, ensuring code quality before committing
- **Morgan** - HTTP request logger that provides insights into request details for easier debugging and monitoring

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Create .env.dev**
    add
    ```bash
    PORT=8080
    ```

2. **Run the development server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Access the API and Swagger documentation:
    - **Swagger**: Go to `http://localhost:<port>/swagger` to view interactive API documentation (adjust `<port>` as needed in your setup).
    - **API DOCS**: Go to `http://localhost:<port>/api-docs` to get openapi docs as a further usage (adjust `<port>` as needed in your setup).

This setup ensures a well-documented and clean codebase, promoting best practices for backend development in TypeScript.
